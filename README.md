# Rust Binary Database

A lightweight, efficient binary database built with Rust, focusing on high-speed data storage and retrieval. The project implements serialization using `bincode` and provides efficient read/write operations.

## Features
- **Binary Serialization**: Uses `bincode` for compact and fast data storage.
- **Efficient Retrieval**: Supports reading and deserializing data quickly.
- **File-Based Storage**: Saves serialized data into `.bin` files for persistence.
- **Middleware Integration**: Designed to work with middleware for structured command handling.

## Installation
Ensure you have **Rust** installed. If not, install it via [Rustup](https://rustup.rs/):

```sh
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

Clone the repository:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/ashcode002x/adata.git
cd rust-binary-db
```

## Dependencies
This project uses `serde` and `bincode` for serialization. Install dependencies using Cargo:

```sh
cargo add serde serde_derive bincode
```
